Bachelorâ€™s in Business Administration and Public Policy Management by the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) and Master of the Interdisciplinary Human and Applied Social Sciences (UNICAMP). Currently, I am doing a joint PhD Student in Technical University of Berlin - TUB (Germany) and University of Campinas - UNICAMP (Brazil).

My research interests include studying the science, technology, and innovation (STI) policies in infrastructure sectors, particularly, in the electricity, gas, water, and sewage. In my research, I am assessing the impact of STI policies and programs in the Global South and OECD countries on innovation outputs by using quasi-experimental methods (e.g., Difference-in-Difference, and Synthetic Control, as well as qualitative methods (e.g., Interviews, and Documental Analysis).

In my dissertation I am researching regulatory tools to foster innovation in energy sectors. Please contact me if you are interested in research collaboration, or if you want to know more about my work.
